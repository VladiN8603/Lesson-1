# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Structure**: Single-page application using basic HTML5 markup
- **Minimal Content**: Currently contains only basic elements (heading and paragraph)
- **Client-side Tracking**: Embedded JavaScript for analytics/tracking purposes

## Code Organization
- **Single File Structure**: All content contained in a single `index.html` file
- **Standard HTML5 Document**: Uses proper DOCTYPE declaration and semantic HTML structure

## Design Decisions
- **Simplicity First**: Chosen a minimal approach with basic HTML elements
- **Analytics Integration**: Included tracking scripts early in development, indicating importance of user behavior monitoring
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Pure HTML approach without additional libraries or frameworks

# External Dependencies

## Analytics/Tracking Services
- **Custom Tracking Script**: Embedded JavaScript code with namespace `NS_CSM_*` variables for collecting user interaction data
- **Third-party Analytics**: The tracking code suggests integration with an external analytics or customer success management platform

## Browser Dependencies
- **HTML5 Support**: Requires modern browser support for HTML5 document structure
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Analytics functionality requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser
